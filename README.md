# 🎓 Student Placement Predictor

## 📌 Problem Statement
In many colleges, students are unsure about their placement readiness due to a lack of proper assessment tools. There is no single platform that evaluates a student’s academic performance, technical skills, and test performance to predict placement chances and guide them with improvement suggestions.

This project aims to solve that problem by providing an interactive placement prediction system for students.

- Evaluates skill levels  
- Conducts an online technical assessment  
- Calculates placement probability  
- Suggests suitable job roles and learning resources  

The system uses **rule-based logic and assessment scoring** to determine placement chances.
