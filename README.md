##🎓 Student Placement Predictor
###📌 Problem Statement
In many colleges, students are unsure about their placement readiness due to a lack of proper assessment tools. There is no single platform that evaluates a student’s academic performance, technical skills, and test performance to predict placement chances and guide them with improvement suggestions.

This project aims to solve that problem by providing an interactive placement prediction system for students.

##💡 Solution Approach
The Student Placement Predictor is a Streamlit-based web application that:

Collects student academic and personal details
Evaluates skill levels
Conducts an online technical assessment
Calculates placement probability
Suggests suitable job roles and learning resources
The system uses rule-based logic and assessment scoring to determine placement chances.

##🚀 Project Features
🧾 Student details collection (Name, Email, Mobile, Branch, Year, CGPA)
📘 Skill level selection (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
📝 Online MCQ-based technical test (20 questions)
⏳ Timer-based examination
🧭 Question palette with color indicators:
🔵 Current question
🟢 Answered question
🔴 Not answered question
📊 Placement chance prediction:
High / Medium / Low
💼 Job role recommendations based on skills
📚 Learning references for improvement
📝 Answer review with correct answers and references
